##Hello! This is fullstack app sample

#Teck stack:

front: ts, react, apollo-client, nextjs

Frontend is written in TS+React based on Next.js using Apollo-Clien for graphql.
GraphQL tools are generated by graphql-codegen


back: ts, nodejs, typeorm, grapql
database: postgresql

Backend is written in binding TS, Node.js, graphql using postgresql as database and typeorm as the medium

I didn't want to use Nest.js here for firstly realise backend without framework

Main purpose of this sample is to play around with fullstack developing. While trying to do by my own, I borrowed a lot from Ben Awad fullstack tutorial, thanks him.
